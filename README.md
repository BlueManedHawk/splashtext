# Splash Text

Splash Text is a unified system for splash text, freely usable by any program.  It comes with both a command-line interface and a C subroutine interface, each of which has the same options available.  The invocation of the system can be fine-tuned to the needs of the invoker.

## Installing

Use the makefile to build and install the program.  You will need a C11 compatible libc and compatibility with POSIX, the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, and the XDG home directory system.  I will be happy to port Splash Text to any _open_ and _actively maintained_ systems.  __Ports to obsolete or malicious systems will not be considered__.  Eventually, i do want to get packages available so that one needn't use the makefile.

## Usage

See the manpage `splashtext(6)` for details.  It's also available as a markdown file [here](Docs/splashtext.6.md).
