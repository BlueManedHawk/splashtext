# Code of Law

## Introduction

First off, you are encouraged to print off a copy of the Contributor Covenant, and NOT read it.  Burn it instead to protest its immorality.  This is _not_ a requirement of the code of lawâ€”if you don't have a printer or a safe place to set something on fire or you're unwilling to do this for some other reason, don't do it.  You'll be fine.

This document complies with [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119), except that decapitalized instances of the imperatives shall be interpreted with the same force as their capitalized counterparts.  When updating this document, clauses of the form "shall not be allowed" should be preferred over ones of the form "shall be prohibited", and so on for all defined imperatives.

## Government

This document shall be considered the sole source of the rules, and should remain so into the future.  Any changes to be made to this document shall be made only with consensus, and shall take effect immediately.

@BlueManedHawk is currently the only person with collaborator access to this repository.   He may use these powers for any reason except to modify this document without consensus; however, anyone may challenge any of his decisions for any reason.  If this happens, BlueManedHawk's powers shall be considered suspended until a consensus is reached on whether the decision was a good idea.  If there is consensus that his decision was not a good idea, the decision shall be promptly reversed.

Decisions shall be made by consensus.

## Duties

Members are strongly recommended to contribute discussion to any issue or pull request which impacts them.  Members shall not be allowed to directly attack other living people.  Members shall not be discriminated based upon qualities which they cannot control.

Anyone may open a pull request in this repository.  Such a pull request should follow the contribution guidelines.  BlueManedHawk may accept or reject any pull request; however, if there is a consenus among members that a pull request should be either rejected or accepted, such a consensus shall override a decision.

## Criminal Justice

If it is found that a member is violating this code of law, that member shall be put on trial before a randomly-selected jury of twelve of their peers.  Any member shall be given adequate time to state their viewpoint upon the situation, including the potential criminal.  If, after all who desire to speak on the trial have done so, the jury comes to consensus that the member on trial is a criminal, the member shall have their ability to do the thing in which they screwed up suspended until they can prove that they can follow the rules.  If there is no consensus, or the consensus is that the member is not a criminal, the member shall be let free.

When convicting a criminal, the jury must give a clear description of what the criminal must do to atone for their crimes.  A criminal shall always have the ability to ask for clarification or rewording.  The description of what they must do shall be set in stone unless consensus exists that it is wrong.

A criminal conviction shall not result in the removal of a criminal's basic rights of personhood.
